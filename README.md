# This is the archive of the ZoomOut WhatsApp update channel

## Folder Structure

Every message is stored in its own folder, I prefer to write in English so in each folder there is an `en.md` file with the message in English.
The he.md will be auto translated to Hebrew using Claude Code.

## Requirements

Every message will include:

- A TL;DR summary at the top (auto-generated using Claude Code)
- Link to the WhatsApp channel
- Link to the file in the repository
- Description of AI usage in the message
