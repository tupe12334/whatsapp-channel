# WhatsApp Update Channel

> **TL;DR:** This is a WhatsApp channel for sharing insights about modern software development, focusing on general paradigms, practices, and perspectives rather than language-specific or technology-specific topics. Readers can request topics they want covered.

Hi everyone, I'm opening this WhatsApp update channel to be able to share with you all around modern development. As part of my perspective about modern development, I will not be dealing with language or tech-specific topics but more about general paradigms, practices, and perspectives.
You are welcome to ask for any topic you want me to cover.
