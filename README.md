# This is the archive of the ZoomOut WhatsApp update channel

Link: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb7ZXok5kg7Di82iSt1S

## Folder Structure

Every message is stored in its own folder, I prefer to write in English so in each folder there is an `en.md` file with the message in English.
The he.md will be auto translated to Hebrew using Claude Code.

## Requirements

In the end of every message there will be:

- Link the the whatsapp channel
- Link to the file in the repository
- Description of any AI usage in the message if applicable
