# Building packages and open source

While I had worked on this channel I had encounter a small issue, there is no cli tool that can convert my markdown files that I write in English (Its easier for me :P) to the WhatsApp supported format. I asked form ChatGPT to find me one and it failed to do so.

So what have I done? I built one, and let me clarify, when I'm saying "I" I mean "we" who is we? Me and Claud Code, my best friend.

I started by making sure manually that there is no such tool indeed, Then I started a new Repository and Initialized Centy (My Issue management tool of choice, Yes I do not use GitHub for issue management, I will write about it later).

After defining the tool and what i Expect it to do: <https://github.com/tupe12334/md-to-whatsapp/blob/main/.centy/issues/15348787-7f41-4e20-8c0f-33b52cf0d1e8/issue.md>

I instructed Claud Code to start working on it, Yes, as simple as that.

And this is what I think most channels missing, The AI and LLMs are tools, they didn't came to replace us (at least not yet) the power to provide a tested, documented, well written lib and cli toke me around 30 minutes of work, while in the mean time had actually open a issue report for the roo code project <https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/10277>, and wrote this article.

This is the power that we, as the developers of the future should embrace, not replacing our mind with AI, but increasing our hands with it.
